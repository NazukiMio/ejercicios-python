Sonnet 1:
From fairest creatures we desire increase, 
That thereby beauty’s rose might never die, 
But as the riper should be found in thee, 
And to thyself unchangeable am I.

Sonnet 2:
When forty winters besiege thy brow, 
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, 
Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now, 
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held.

Sonnet 3:
Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou view’st, 
Now is the time that face should form another; 
Or whether doth my mind, in thought, abuse 
The substance of thy form, or true and fair.

Sonnet 4:
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend 
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy? 
Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend, 
And being frank, she lends to thee alone.

Sonnet 5:
Those hours that with gentle work did frame 
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, 
Will be forgot, and many a fairer name, 
In the lust of youth, shall make its hollow claim.

Sonnet 6:
Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface 
In thee thy summer ere thou be distill'd; 
Make sweet some fragrance of the fading grace, 
And live in the fresh seasons, not in the grave.

Sonnet 7:
Lo, in the orient when the gracious light 
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye 
Doth homage to his new-revealed sight, 
Serving with twofold zeal, as they admire.

Sonnet 8:
Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly? 
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy; 
Why love's just up to the hour of his calling, 
Sweet air in these fast beats will soon decay.

Sonnet 9:
Is it thy will thy image should keep clear? 
Some gift of thought awaits to keep or die. 
If thou dost still defy, I think you’d believe 
If simple joys could be your victory now.

Sonnet 10:
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, 
And make me travel to your shining way? 
If heaven’s joy should greet us in the night, 
Come, come, the day will soon be close behind.
